 NEWS/ChangeLog for iPlots package
===================================

1.1-4	2011-07-18
     o	add a NAMESPACE since it becomes compulsory in new R versions
	and we need to work around locked namespace environments


1.1-3	2009-02-06
     o	fix ibox and multivariate plots to accept ivars and a whole
	iset as input (bug#60)

     o	allow iplots to load when NOAWT=1 is set event if the JVM
	does not support AWT in R (necessary to be able to install
	iplots in Mac OS X 10.5 for JGR)


1.1-2	2008-04-12
     o	add iplot.size() to get/set the size of a plot

     o  added Swing menu to ibase


1.1-1	2007-09-07
     o	allow the use of iplots within the R GUI on Mac OS X, but show a
	warning on possible event loop deadlocks.

     o	update docs to flag S3 methods correctly

     o	map S4 show to S3 print so iset/ivar are shown correctly

     o	add `$<-.iset` method, enhance and fix other accessor methods
	for both iset and ivar. Added examples (in ?ivar and ?iset)

     o	add iset.rm() which allows removal of iSets and all associated
	plots

     o	add iplot.location() which is experimental for now until nesting
	of plots is defined properly


1.1-0	2007-08-22
     o	use S4 classes for ivar and iset

     o	add subseting and subassignment operator support to ivar and
	to allow users to treat them very much like data frames and
	vectors repectively

     o	move to rJava 0.5 registration facilities

     o	add batch mode support to selection API


1.0-8   2007-06-3
     o  changes in ibase package


1.0-7	2007-04-18
     o	add support for imap


1.0-6	2007-03-02
     o	fix issues with compiling Common with certain compilers


1.0-5	2006-10-11
     o	ivar.new now compares the contents with existing variables and
	will return original reference if the variable already exists

     o	imosaic and ipcp support variable-length arguments

     o	imosaic accepts additional "type" parameter to specify the
	desired mosaic plot variation

     o	iset, iplot and iopt handling ahs been streamlined and better
	documented. It is now possible to obtain individual objects
	for iset, ivar, iplot and iobj.

     o	each plot type has a distinct subclass of "iplot" and thus can
	be identified as such


1.0-4	2006-08-29
     o	several variations of mosaic plots exhibited incorrect
	behavior with respect to empty cells, this has been now fixed


1.0-3	2006-08-20

...


0.1-0	2003/03/23
